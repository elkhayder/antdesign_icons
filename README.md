# Package for AntDesign Icons

An icon is a graphical representation of meaning. Icons can be used to express actions, state, and even to categorize data. [Ant Design's icons](https://ant.design/components/icon/) adhere to the following two principles and are designed for cross-platform consistency:

-  Graphics that are clear, intuitive, and simple enjoy a higher degree of recognition and are more easily understood
-  All icons in the user interface should be consistent in style (detail design, perspective, stroke weight, etc.)

This is a Flutter package for Ant Icons.
